# LangGraph Agents and Workflows 🚀

A hands-on collection of projects demonstrating the power of the [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) framework to build AI-driven workflows and intelligent agents.  
This repository is a practical resource for learning, experimenting, and creating LLM-powered applications using LangChain.

---

## 📌 About
This repo contains a variety of **LangGraph implementations** ranging from simple LLM calls to complex **multi-step agent workflows**.  
Each example is designed to help you:
- Understand **LangGraph's building blocks** (LLMs, prompts, memory, tools, agents, retrievers).
- Create **custom AI agents** for specialized tasks.
- Orchestrate **multi-step workflows** for real-world use cases.

---

## 🛠 Features
- **LangChain Basics** – prompts, chains, and memory.
- **AI Agents** – reactive, plan-execute, and conversational agents.
- **Tool Integration** – connect APIs, databases, and external tools.
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** workflows.
- **Multi-Agent Systems** – collaborative agents for complex tasks.
- **Practical Use Cases** – chatbot, data extraction, automation scripts.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kumbhakarn/LangGraph-Agents-and-Workflows.git
cd LangChain-Agents-and-Workflows
````

### 2️⃣ Install dependencies

It's recommended to use a virtual environment:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Run examples

Navigate to the desired folder and execute:

```bash
python example.py
```

---

## 📦 Requirements

* Python 3.9+
* `langchain`
* `openai` (or any other LLM provider)
* `chromadb` or `faiss` (for vector storage)
* `dotenv` (for environment variables)
* `langchain-groq` (for free llm)

Install all dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📚 Learning Goals

By exploring this repo, you’ll learn:

* How LangChain orchestrates LLM calls.
* When to use **chains** vs **agents**.
* How to integrate external tools.
* How to build production-ready workflows.

## 💡 Inspiration

LangChain makes it easy to create intelligent applications by combining LLMs with tools, memory, and reasoning steps.
This repo is my personal journey in **understanding, experimenting, and building** with LangChain — and hopefully a resource for you too.
